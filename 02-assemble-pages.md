# Assemble and Punch Your Pages

For this step, you can use pre-cut pages or cut your own to a size of your choosing.  

## Folios and Signatures

A *folio* is one sheet of paper folded precisely in half.  
A *signature* is a stack of several signatures nestled together.  

For this book, we will use five signatures of three pages each, so you need 15 folios (or 15 sheets of paper). 
1. Stack 3 pages together and carefully fold the whole thing in half, creasing the fold with a bone folder or other flat object. Congratulations, you have a signature!
2. Take a paper awl and punch 5 holes in the crease through all 3 sheets. You should probably measure before you do this so that they are equidistant and replicable ;)
3. Repeat with four more stacks of three sheets each.

When you stack all five signatures together, the holes should more or less align at the folded edges.
