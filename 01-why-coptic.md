# Why Use Coptic Stitch?

When there are so many ways to create books, you might wonder why you'd choose this notoriously difficult method. Here are a few reasons:  

- This is a glue-free method.
- The binding looks beautiful and you can leave it exposed.
- Coptic bindings tend to be looser, which allows your pages to lie totally flat when you open the book. This is great for sketchbooks!
- Sometimes it's fun to do things the hard way.  

There are many visual tutorials on coptic stitch available online. 
This is a very simple instructional manual, but feel free to reference the wealth of other resources available for further guidance.
