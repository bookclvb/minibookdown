# Stitching the Pages

*Supplies you will need: Curved needle, waxed thread, scissors*

Be gentle. You can always un-thread the binding and start over, but you can't un-tear pages!  

1. Open the first signature and bring the needle through the first hole, going from the **outside** of the fold to the inside. Leave 6+ inches loose outside the signature. 
2. Bring the needle and thread through the second hole, from the inside to the outside. 
3. Now bring the needle through the second hole on the second signature.
4. Are you confused yet? Me too!
5. Throw it on the ground and go do something else.
