A signature is a stack of several signatures nestled together. For this book, we will use five signatures of three pages each, so you need 15 folios (or 15 sheets of paper). 1. Stack 3 pages together and carefully fold the whole thing in half, creasing the fold with a bone folder or other flat object. Congratulations, you have a signature! 2. Take a paper awl and punch 5 holes in the crease through all 3 sheets. You should probably measure before you do this so that they are equidistant and replicable ;) 3. Repeat with four more stacks of three sheets each. When you stack all five signatures together, the holes should more or less align at the folded edges.

You can always un-thread the binding and start over, but you can’t un-tear pages! Open the first signature and bring the needle through the first hole, going from the outside of the fold to the inside. Leave 6+ inches loose outside the signature. Bring the needle and thread through the second hole, from the inside to the outside. Now bring the needle through the second hole on the second signature. Are you confused yet? Me too! Throw it on the ground and go do something else.
